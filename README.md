# MeleeCPUTournament
Attempt to automatically handle SSBM CPU tournaments

Contains simple commands to *test* some glue tying the [MeleeAutomator](https://github.com/francoislg/MeleeAutomator) and [ChallongeCSharpDriver](https://github.com/francoislg/ChallongeCSharpDriver) 

## Warning

Very experimental, has little and ugly code.
